* **The author is the first component of any APA citation.** The author of a source can be a single person, a group, or a company. For a single author, you should write the full last name followed by a comma and then the author name’s initial. If there are two authors, follow the aforementioned format and list authors in the order that they appear in your source. If there are more than eight authors, list the first six authors followed by three ellipsis points, then the last author.
* **Date.** The date when the presentation was delivered is the second component of APA citation. There is no need to get the full date of the presentation. Just write the year of publication inside a parenthesis, followed by a period. If there is no discernable date, write n.d for no date inside the parenthesis.
* **Title of the Presentation.** The title is the third component of APA citation. When writing the title, you should capitalize the first word of the title and subtitle, any proper nouns, and all significant words in the title. It is important to indicate the format of the source, such as video, PowerPoint slides, etc., after the title of the presentation. Write the format within brackets.
* **Venue Where the Presentation was Delivered.** Another component that one should add is the venue where the presentation was delivered. This often includes the name of the event and the city/state and country where it took place. However, it might be important to note that this information will not always be available.
* **Retrieval Information.** The retrieval information is the last component of APA citation. It helps your readers easily locate your sources. You can use the PowerPoint Presentation’s Uniform Resource Locator (URL ) if there is any.
